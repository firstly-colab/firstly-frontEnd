## Problem Background

Jitters. Butterflies. What-ifs. All of these are common parts of the pre-date experience and we at Firstly want to help daters feel less nervous before meeting someone new. Some reports estimate that more than 300 million people worldwide use web and/or mobile applications for dating, including nearly 50% of American adults under 50.

Although online dating is essentially ubiquitous and meant to be fun, many daters worry about meeting expectations, making a good impression, and finding things to talk about. We know it’s normal and natural for daters to feel nervous before a first date, but we want to provide concrete ways for daters to feel more prepared and less nervous heading into the date.

## Research and Validation

Using email-based surveys and in-depth interviews, we validated the existence and extent of our problem space and identified root causes of pre-date anxiety. During our interviews, 100% of participants reported feeling nervous before a first date.

They all reported feeling particularly nervous about the quality of conversation on the date and said that enjoyable conversation was a key indicator of a good date. Specific pain points they had experienced during first dates included awkward silences, stilted conversation, having difficulty thinking of conversation topics, and concern that their date did not find them interesting.

All participants described a strong desire for high-quality conversation that feels more meaningful than small talk and more natural than an interview. Furthermore, 100% of interviewees identified worrying about meeting their dates’ expectations as an additional source of nerves. They all reported hoping to feel more confident heading into the date. Nerves heading into the date were another key pain point, with 67% of participants reporting feeling most nervous right before the date. 

## Solution Explanation

The goal of Firstly is to address the root causes of pre-date anxiety and help daters feel less nervous heading into a first date. Based on the specific pain points identified during our research, we hypothesize that users will feel less nervous before a date if they feel more confident and well-prepared to have high-quality conversation. Therefore, we decided to focus on the following features for launch in August 2022: 

- Generation of different conversation starters in the format of fun, open-ended questions that are curated to specific interests of the daters
- A questionnaire that allows users to provide information about themselves and their date through multiple choice questions to help identify relevant conversation starters 
- Words of encouragement and confidence-boosting experiences visible throughout the user journey
